# Quiet Cast

Quiet Cast is a home for music and print interviews from musicians. It is the sister site of QuietCalmRecords.com which sells the music you can hear on Quiet Casts in vinyl formats. The site was built using React and Redux on the front-end and Sanity Headless CMS on the back. Apollo Client and GraphQL were used to query the data from Sanity. 

## Installation

Run npm i to install all the necessary packages needed to get the application up and running on the development end. 

```bash
npm i
```

## Adding a new mix/interview

Head to sanity.io using the credentials supplied from Quiet Calm Records to access the UI and add/edit music and interview content.
